Task 0. File 0-print_listint.c
This funtion will print all elements of a list
Task 1. File 1-listint_len.c
This Funtion will Return number of the elements found in a linked list
Task 2. File 2-add_nodeint.c
This Funtion adds at the start of a list a new node
Task 3. File 3-add_nodeint_end.c
This Funtion adds at the end of a list a new node
Task 4. File 4-free_listint.c
The funtion will free a list
Task 5. File 5-free_listint2.c
The funtion will free a list. This funtion will set the head to NULL
Task 6 File 6-pop_listint.c
The funtion will delete the head node from a linked list returning the head node data and return s 0 if linked list is empty
Task 7 File 7-get_nodeint.c
Index will start from 0 and the funtion will return nth node in a linked list. if no nth node returns 0
Task 8 File 8-sum_listint.c
This sum funtion will return the sum of all data in a linked list returning 0 if list is empty
Task 9 File  9-insert_nodeint.c
This funtion will insert  a new node in a given position. idx is index or the position where node is to be added and the index starts from 0. This program will return the address associated with the new node or null if it fails
Task 10. File  10-delete_nodeint.c
This funtion will delete the node at index index in a linked list and index will start from 0. The funtion will return 1 when successfull or -1 if it fails
Task 11. File 100-reverse_listint.c
Funtion will reverse a linked list
Task 12. File 101-print_listint_safe.c
This funtion will;
-Return number of nodes in the linked list
-Print list with a loop
-Go through the linked list only at once
-Will exit with status 98 when the funtion fails
Task 13. File 102-free_listint_safe.c
The funtion frees a list with a loop and return thr size of list which was free'd seeting head to null
Task 14. File 103-find_loop.c
This funtion will find the loop of a list
Where no loop return null
Ensure declaring of a max of 2 variables in the funtion 
return address of node. this address shows where loop starts
